description: "**Project context:** Across the globe, citizens, governments, private parties and academics are witnessing a multiplicity in approaches to urban development happening in their cities. Here top-down planning, bottom-up grassroots movements and entrepreneurial motivations collide, revealing conflicts, existing power relations and opportunities for cooperation. **Question:** What will be the division of responsibilities when it comes to determining the city of the future?  **Approach:** Led a 15 person workshop 'Citizens as Citybuilders' aimed at answering this question, designed marketing materials, and organized symposium content. **Result and deliverables:** One-day symposium."
