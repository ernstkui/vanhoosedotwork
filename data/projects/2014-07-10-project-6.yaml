description: "**Project context:** The Province of Friesland is currently rewriting its provincial vision for 2020. **Question:** The Province asked Architectuur Lokaal to organize ateliers with different stakeholders in order to find out the current issues which occur on a local level. VanHooseDotWork was asked by Architectuur Lokaal to lead four workshops wherein stakeholders were asked questions on different theme’s and challenges. **Approach:** During the ateliers we used maps and drawing to capture current data and challenges. These were later combined, analyzed and translated into 10 opportunities to be used by the Province in its vision for 2020. **Results and deliverables:** The results of the workshops were collected in the publication ‘Atelier Omgevinsvisie Friesland’ and given to the Province."
