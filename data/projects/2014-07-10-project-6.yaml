description: "Recents cuts to agriculture subsidy have left farmers and their holdings in the wake of a speeding policy boat. With this 'mini' research, I analyzed the correlation between EU agricultural policies and Dutch spatial planning since 1950 to understand the implications of this relationship on the future of Dutch rural areas. Research resulting in a fact sheet of text and infographics."
