description: "**Project context:** Following the hackathon 'Re-design the Netherlands in 48 hours' our team came up with the idea of UrDNA. Can you imagine what it would be like to provide feedback about your neighborhood on a daily basis? In the palm of your han? While waiting at the bus stop? During the hackathon we have developed a concept and prototype that makes this possible: uDNA. Our interface can be used on a phone or at an interactive board placed throughout an area. This data is collected through the answering of questions by residents and visitors to an area and concerns different themes such as safety, health and accessibility. How do you perceive the noise level in this area? Do you feel safe here? The collected data and feedback provides a picture about the current situation in an area, as well as the desired situation to reach the ‘ideal’ DNA of an area. This information can be compared to existing data sets and norms, and also used at a higher scale to make comparisons between cities. Most importantly, it can be used by policymakers to make better informed decision that are based on real-time data. **Results and deliverables:** The first phase of this project is currently being tested with a pilot in the muncipality of Alphen aan den Rijn. Stay tuned for updates!"
