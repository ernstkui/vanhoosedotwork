description: "**Project context:** The Province of Drenthe is busy writing their new Omgevingsvisie.  **Question:** What is the DNA of the four largest cities? What are their current challenges and what challenges to they expect to face? What are the opportunities for working together? **Approach:** Together with a team of advisers from Over Morgen, we organized a series of workshops in order to collect data from different key figures in each city. Quantitative data was also collected in order to provide a complete picture of the DNA for each city. **Results and deliverables:** A StoryMap with all of the collected data to be delivered the end of june. Stay tuned!"
