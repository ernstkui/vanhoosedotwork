category: "DIY Urbanism: an inside-out perspective" 
description: "Practices of ‘do-it-yourself’ urbanism are increasingly recognized as a new form of engaged citizenship in urban change. Because of their insurgent nature however, these initiatives are at risk of marginalization and exclusion from recognized urban policy processes. One explanation of this risk is that research tends to focus on external political and legal conditions, while knowledge related to internal group dynamics remains obscure. Building on the concept of social capital, this research examines DIY urbanism from an inside-out perspective, analyzing how internal organization affects external connectivity. Two case studies are analyzed, a group of skateboarders in London and a cultural collective in Amsterdam. Made use of qualitative research methods, primarily semi-structured interviewing and analysis of policy documents. Result: academic thesis and article"
