description: "**Project context:** Practices of ‘do-it-yourself’ urbanism are increasingly recognized as a new form of engaged citizenship in urban change. These initiatives are however at risk of marginalization and exclusion from formal urban planning processes. **Question:** Why do some DIY groups manage to gain recognition for their initiatives, while others do not? **Approach:** Examined DIY urbanism from the inside, anaylzing the internal organization of two DIY groups, a community of skateboarders in London and a cultural collective in Amsterdam, to understand how internal capacity affects each group's external connectivity to the public, local government and other stakeholders. Methods included interviews with group members, experts and local civil servants and an analysis of social and print media records. **Results and deliverables:** Masters thesis and the article 'The Social Capital of Do-It-Yourself Urbanism: An Inside-Out Perspective on Citizen Activism in London and Amsterdam' (currently under review for publication)."
