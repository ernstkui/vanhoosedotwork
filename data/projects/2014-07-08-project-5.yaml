description: "The decommisioned Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant was orginally used for the enrichment of uranium. Currently a 10 square mile underground plume of contaminants sits under the site. With funding from the National Department of Energy, our research studio spent 36 months visualizing the contaminated area and creating a strategic vision for the future use of the plant. As a Paducah native, I took responsibility for communicating with local parties and sharing the studio's three years of work, which took the form of a traveling exhibtion consisting of past research, interactive models and possible alternative futures."
