description: "**Project context:** As the urban areas of the Netherlands continue to require high quality infrastructure, services and and access to housing, so will they demand an equally high quality surrounding rural area that ensures access to recreation, local food and green services. **Question:** What is the potential of the surrounding peatlands to match the needs of the Rotterdam-The Hague metropolitan area? **Approach:** Research methods included measuring the economic, socio-cultural and historic value of one case study, the â€˜Zouteveensepolder', an important green landscape nestled in between the growing metropolitan areas of Rotterdam and The Hague. Research included the review of relevant policy documents, interviews with experts and local residents, and a spatial analysis using GIS and map data. **Results and deliverables:** The results of this research can be read in the publication ['Let's Talk About the Polders Again'](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ff8wfogvycetsnl/20130918_Landschap_FinalReport_KatherineVanHoose%20%281%29.pdf/?raw=1) which served as the basis for the analysis of four other case studies in the Netherlands."
