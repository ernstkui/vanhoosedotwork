description: "The “typical” Dutch veenweidegebieden (peat lands) in the Deltametropolis area in the Netherlands can be considered a landscape anomaly, both physically and technically. Over the last 50 years, stakeholders, developers and policy-makers have give more attention to the quality of their urban areas, often leaving landscapes as an open, underdeveloped afterthought. As urban areas continue to require quality infrastructure, services and residences, so will the Deltametropolis demand an equally as high rural environment that ensures access to recreation, local food and green services, as well as water management and good air quality. As part of a larger research program, I analyzed the future role of the Zouteveensepolder in Midden-Delfland, which is expected to change due to its location within the increasingly developed Rotterdam-The Hague Metropolitan Area. I specifically looked at different ways to operationalize and measure the intrinsic, economic and socio-cultural value of these types of landscapes. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods were used including interviews with experts and residents, analysis of policy documents, context analysis and spatial analysis using geometric networks.
