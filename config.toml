I combine the structured methods of social science with the creativity of design in projects related to the built environment. This approach includes communication, graphic and analytical skills, which I have developed over the past six years in both professional and academic contexts. I have found this approach to be valuable on a number of scales and for a variety of projects. For an idea of what this approach can mean for you, please see [the services](#services) below or some of [my work](#portfolio). Let's get in touch!"
