		description = "Hi! My name is Katherine and I am an American currently based in Utrecht, the Netherlands. I am a designer and researcher with a passion for cities. I believe that when the structured and analytical methods of social science are combined with the creative power of design, powerful solutions to seemingly complex issues in the built environment can be reached. This approach combines communication, graphic and analytical skills, which I have developed over the past six years in both professional and academic contexts. Through these experiences, I have found this approach to be valuable on a number of scales and for a variety of projects. I creatively turn ideas into concrete results for clients with social issues in the built environment. For an idea of what this approach can mean for you, please see the services section below. Let's get in touch!"
